- For the chart, use the actual scores to fill in the chart, and ensure the number associated with the score is placed on the right place on the chart., e.g., here is the chart for 2 Happy, 8 Positive, and 3 Loud:

Happy      [-2--------]    Sad
Positive   [-------8--]    Negative
Loud       [--3-------]    Quiet

- Ensure there's a blank line between each bullet of output.

- Create the output using the formatting above.

- In the markdown, don't use formatting like bold or italics. Make the output maximially readable in plain text.

- Do not output warnings or notesâ€”just the requested sections.
